    	<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>My name is Maximilian BÃ¶hm! Nice to meet you and welcome to my blog!</p>
		
		<p>I'm currently working on my research focused on carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, an ancient protein family with fascinating evolutionary history and biotechnological potential.</p>
		
		<p>In this blog, I share insights from my research and work by others in the field, present data analyses, and hopefully inspire people about science! You'll find content covering:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Biochemistry:</strong> Protein structure, function, and evolution</li>
			<li><strong>Bioinformatics:</strong> Data analysis, computational methods, and visualization</li>
			<li><strong>Research insights:</strong> Current findings and methodologies</li>
			<li><strong>Scientific computing:</strong> Tools and techniques for data analysis</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you have questions or want to discuss any topics, feel free to contact me via GitHub or email! I try to respond as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p>Thanks for visiting!<br>
		Max</p>
