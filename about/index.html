<div class="blurb">
    	<h1>Hey there! üëã</h1>
		<p>I'm Max (Maximilian B√∂hm if we're being formal), and welcome to my little corner of the internet!</p>
		
		<p>I'm currently working on my PhD at Uppsala University, diving deep into the fascinating world of carbon monoxide dehydrogenases. These are ancient enzymes with incredible evolutionary history and tons of biotechnological potential ‚Äì basically, they're molecular machines that have been perfecting their craft for billions of years.</p>
		
		<p>When I'm not wrestling with protein purification or trying to make sense of phylogenetic trees, you'll find me writing about:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The science stuff:</strong> Biochemistry, bioinformatics, and computational methods (with actual code that hopefully works)</li>
			<li><strong>The real stuff:</strong> What PhD life is actually like ‚Äì the good, the messy, and the "why did I choose this?" moments</li>
			<li><strong>The random stuff:</strong> Cultural observations from a German living in Sweden, hot takes on academic culture, and whatever else crosses my mind</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>I believe science communication should be accessible and honest. That means talking about the 90% of experiments that don't work, the imposter syndrome that hits at 2 AM, and the small victories that keep us going. It also means sharing the genuine excitement of discovery and the joy of understanding how biological systems work at a molecular level.</p>

		<p>Originally from Germany, I'm now based in Uppsala, Sweden, where I'm learning that fika is serious business and that complaining about the weather is apparently optional (still working on that second part).</p>
		
		<p>Got questions about my research? Want to share your own PhD struggles or Swedish cultural observations? Just feel like chatting about science? Hit me up on GitHub or email! I love connecting with other researchers and curious humans.</p>

		<p>Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that resonates with you!<br>
		Max ‚úåÔ∏è</p>
