My website and blog have a new home 🎉

After a great time hosting this site on [GitHub Pages](https://boehmax.github.io/),  
I decided to move to a new platform to make writing, updating, and managing content easier.

👉 You can now find me at [boehmax.org](https://boehmax.org)

If you’re subscribed or have bookmarks pointing here, please update them.
See you there!
