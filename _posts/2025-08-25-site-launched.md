## I did it!
Well, I finally got around to putting this old website together. The neat thing about it? It’s powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to write my posts. Honestly, it’s a lot easier than I thought it would be.

Big thanks to [Hank Quinlan](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) for the helpful blog post!

## What happens next?
I want this blog to be chill and cozy. Its goal is to educate and inspire. I’ll be posting about science concepts, topics I’ve researched and feel confident talking about, quick-and-dirty data science tricks from a self-learner, and anything else I think might be useful or interesting to others. Some posts will be in German and some in English depending on my mood.

## When will all of this happen?
Right now, I’m finishing up my PhD in Chemistry, so I’m juggling my thesis, research on nickel-containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases, a social life, and now this blog. So let’s see how it all evolves!

Hope to reach some of you! And hopefully you will find something of use to you! Cheers!
