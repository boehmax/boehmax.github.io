## Updates to the Webpage
I had some time on hand the last few days, and with the help of GitHubs Copilot, I change layout and theme of this webpage.
I also added some more websites that might be of interest to you! :)

## [Apps](http://boehmax.github.io/apps)
Whenever I feel like I need to share some code with my collegues, that are not super comfortable with coding, I try to put that code in an R Shiny WebApp. Those Apps I collected here for easy access. Most of them are highly specific for data analysis of instrument output, but still worth a look! Maybe you are lucky and you find something that fits your needs.

## [Resources](http://boehmax.github.io/resources)
Counting all higher education I underwent from Bachelor to Master to now PhD, it has been a journey of almost 10 years now. Trough that time I met good and bad resources for learning. Collected some of my favourits in this webpage. Keep in mind that my formal education is Chemistry, so some of you might find my suggestions trivial or too far away from Biochem/Bioinformatics if your education has been completly focusing on that feeld. If you have further resources I am always happy to add new things to this page! It will grow organically, so check in once in a while. The idea is also that I am going to make blog posts for some of the resources, to go a bit more indepth why I think they are  great.

## [Lab Protocol](http://boehmax.github.io/protocols)
This is an external link that will bring you to my protocol page on GitHub. This could be actually to most usefull thing on this webpage. Especially if you are also in the field of Metallo Enzymes. The protocols range a wide from: "well structure" to "oh my, this is not good". It should be obvious to the reader where to place the protocol. For more information refer to the README of that repo. :)

## What's next?
Now that I am some what happy with this webpage, the only thing that is missing is a steady stream of blog posts. Let's hope my motivation doesn't break. See you! -Max
