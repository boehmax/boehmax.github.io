So, I've been living in Uppsala for a while now doing my PhD, and let me tell you â€“ moving from Germany to Sweden has been... an experience. Both countries are pretty similar in many ways (organized, efficient, love their bureaucracy), but there are some hilarious differences that nobody warned me about.

## The Great Fika Mystery

First of all, **fika is not just coffee**. I made this mistake early on and I'm pretty sure I offended several Swedes without realizing it.

In Germany, coffee is fuel. You drink it quickly between meetings or while working. In Sweden, fika is a sacred ritual. It's coffee + pastry + sitting down + actually talking to people. You don't rush fika. You don't skip fika. You definitely don't suggest having fika "to go."

I learned this the hard way when I suggested we grab coffee quickly between lab meetings. The look of horror on my Swedish colleague's face was... memorable. Now I budget at least 30 minutes for any fika-related activity.

## The Weather Conversation Paradox

Germans complain about the weather constantly. It's like our national sport.

Swedes also talk about the weather constantly, but they're... optimistic about it? Even when it's -15Â°C and the sun sets at 3 PM, my lab mates will cheerfully say things like "Oh, but look how beautiful the snow is!" or "At least it's not raining!"

Meanwhile, I'm over here wondering if I've accidentally joined a cult of eternal weather optimists.

## The Silence is Not Awkward (Apparently)

This took some getting used to. In Germany, we fill silence with conversation. In Sweden, silence is just... normal.

The first few times I was on the bus or in an elevator with Swedes, I kept thinking I should say something. But everyone was just quietly existing, and it wasn't awkward for them at all.

Now I actually kind of love it. It's weirdly peaceful to just be quiet sometimes without feeling like you need to perform social interaction.

## Shopping: A Strategic Mission

Swedish grocery stores close early. Like, really early. Coming from Germany where you can shop until 10 PM in many places, I was not prepared for stores closing at 6 or 7 PM.

I've definitely had that moment of standing outside ICA at 7:15 PM, holding my sad shopping list, wondering if I can survive on whatever random food is in my freezer.

Also, **why is everything so expensive?** I love Sweden, but my wallet is still in shock. A simple lunch can cost what I used to spend on dinner for two in Germany.

## The Language Adventures

Swedish and German are related languages, which sounds helpful until you realize that means I constantly think I understand something and then it turns out to mean something completely different.

My favorite embarrassing moment: I confidently told someone I was "kÃ¶tt" (thinking it meant "cold" like German "kalt") when I actually told them I was "meat." The confusion on their face was priceless.

Also, everyone speaks perfect English, which is amazing for communication but terrible for my Swedish learning motivation. Why struggle with grammar when everyone can understand me perfectly in English?

## The Hiking Culture is Real

Germans like the outdoors, but Swedes have taken it to another level. Everyone here seems to own professional-grade hiking equipment and has strong opinions about the best trails.

I showed up to my first group hike with regular sneakers and a backpack from high school. I looked like a tourist among a group of outdoor gear catalog models.

But honestly, the nature here is incredible. I've become one of those people who goes for forest walks to "clear my head" (and yes, it actually works).

## Work-Life Balance Actually Exists

This is probably the biggest culture shock. In Germany, there's definitely pressure to work long hours and show your dedication. In Sweden, people actually leave the office at normal times and don't apologize for it.

My supervisor was genuinely concerned when I stayed late in the lab during my first week. "Is everything okay? Do you need help with something?" No, I just thought I was supposed to work until 9 PM to look dedicated.

Turns out, working efficiently during normal hours and then having a life is not only acceptable â€“ it's expected.

## The Bottom Line

Despite the initial culture shock (and my continued struggles with grocery shopping timing), I absolutely love living in Sweden. The quality of life is amazing, people are incredibly kind once you understand the social rules, and I've never felt safer walking around a city.

Plus, my research benefits from the Swedish approach to work-life balance. Turns out, well-rested brains are better at solving protein folding problems. Who knew?

**To my fellow international academics:** What culture shocks have you experienced? I'd love to hear about your adventures in adaptation!

*P.S. â€“ If any Swedes are reading this and cringing at my cultural observations, please know they come from a place of affection! And if you have tips for better grocery shopping strategies, I'm all ears.* ðŸ˜„
